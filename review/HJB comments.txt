Very nice manuscript, very good arguments and straight logic. What I am missing is a story. It reads a bit like a report. As a reader I do not want to connect the pieces together but I need to be guided. Therefore, this would by main suggestion: Make it a story. There are also suggestions in the manuscript. Make more logical connections. Why do I study this? What is the underlying question?

Let me give one example. You start “Results” with the section Field desorption mass spectroscopy. At this point it is not clear at all, what these results are good for. Why do you measure it? It becomes quite clear later, when you introduce the adhesion fluid at the end of each pillar. Therefore, you either need to motivate it in the introduction, or shift this part to a point, where the motivation is clear.
