Please find attached my comments on the introduction. I would try to structure it a bit better (organise similar points in cohesive paragraphs) and be more concise, i.e. leave out unnecessary info which doesn't help in an introduction to your present study. It helps when you picture yourself explaining your study to a friend who has never heard of what you are doing... what points would you mention to him so that he would understand what you are trying to present here?
