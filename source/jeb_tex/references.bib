abstract = {Tarsal claws, which are common attachment devices in arthropods, interlock with the surface irregularities of the substrata. Most insects have two tarsal claws, but the larvae of some aquatic insects, such as Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, bear only one claw on their tarsi. The range of surface roughness that is sufficient for the function of the single claws of aquatic invertebrates has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the surface texture required for the function of the claws of larvae of the mayfly, Epeorus assimilis. We conducted attachment experiments using replications with defined surface roughness, white light profilometry, videotaping and scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that the choice of an appropriate roughness order is very important. A setting resulting in a cut-off length of approximately thirty times the diameter of the claw tip proved most appropriate for describing the roughness order that is relevant for the functioning of the claws of E. assimilis larvae. Common technical roughness parameters such as Ra, Rq or Rz supplied sufficient differentiation between the tested substrata. E. assimilis larvae require a minimum surface roughness (Ra∼6.0μm) for their claws to grip. At lesser surface roughness, the larvae left the substratum. This was surprising because E. assimilis larvae have been observed to attach even to smooth surfaces. Based on the use of sterile substrata in this experiment, we assume that coverage with biofilm considerably influences the attachment of the larvae.}
