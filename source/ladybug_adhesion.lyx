\begin_layout Abstract
Insects like beetles can stick to various surfaces using hairy pads mediated
 by an oily adhesive fluid.
 It was previously shown that the pads can even attach underwater, presumably
 due to an air bubble trapped around the pad.
 However, the bubble's relative contribution to adhesion via capillary force
 remains unclear.
 To investigate the exact role of bubble, in this study, we perform
\emph on
 in-vivo
\emph default
 underwater adhesion measurements of a ladybug's pad, in the presence and
 absence of trapped bubble and compare it with its adhesion in air.
 Our experiments reveal that on a hydrophobic substrate, even without a
 bubble, the pad can show adhesion underwater comparable to that in air.
 On a hydrophilic substrate, underwater adhesion is significantly reduced,
 with ot without a trapped bubble.
 To explain these results, we develop a simple theoretical model to estimate
 the net adhesion of a hairy pad due to capillary forces.
 Our results demonstrate that the wetting properties of the adhesive fluid
 can help explain the insect's adhesion in both air and underwater conditions.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The question of how insects can walk on smooth surfaces against gravity
 has fascinated scientists for at least the past three centuries

\end_inset

.
 We now know that such animals are able to adhere by using specialized organs
 on their feet called adhesive pads.
 These adhesive pads exist in a variety of types depending on the animal,
 but are generally categorized into: 1)

smooth pads

, geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and others.
 The hairy pads show: 1) compliance to rough surfaces due to their lower
 effective modulus, 2) angle dependent adhesion due to asymmetric hair geometry
 and 3) self-cleaning capability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN20"

\end_inset

, which makes it suitable to adhere to most surfaces reversibly.
 Many of these insects pads also secrete an adhesive fluid, as seen in flies
 and ants

Terrestrial beetles such as the dock beetle or the ladybug have

 consisting of a dense array of hair like structures called setae.
 The setae tips can be discoidal, spatula or pointed shaped, which are distribut
ed throughout the pad depending on sex or species

\begin_layout Standard
While most of the studies on insect adhesion are done under natural conditions
 in air, insect attachment underwater has been relatively unexplored.
 Typically, underwater adhesion is complicated to achieve due to the difficulty
 in displacing the water layer and enable good contact 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN123"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Regardless, a study on leaf beetles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN87"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has revealed that they can in fact attach quite well to surfaces underwater.
 Its hairy pad traps an air bubble underwater, which dewets the surface
 on contact.
 It has been hypothesized that a combination of capillary forces due the
 air bubble and hair contact within the dewetted area results in attachment.
 However, a detailed investigation of the bubble's contribution and necessity
 to adhere to different surfaces is lacking.
 Geckos are also known to adhere underwater, where its shear adhesion force
 on hydrophobic substrates are similar in both air and underwater conditions.
 Interestingly, its adhesion on a fluorinated substrate is even larger underwate
r than in air
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN15"

\end_inset

.
 This has been partially explained by a thermodynamic work of adhesion model,
 assuming full displacement of water at the interface, leading to dry contact
 of hairs with the surface

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to provide a generalized picture of adhesion in
 insects which use hairy pads secreting a fluid for attachment.
 First, we perform adhesion measurements of a single constrained pad of
 a live ladybug beetle in air and underwater conditions on smooth hydrophilic
 and hydrophobic glass surfaces, with a microscopic observation of the contact
 process.
 Second, we develop a simple theoretical model considering capillary forces
 to predict the net adhesion force of a hairy pad under different conditions.
 Finally, we discuss key insights gained from our experiments and model
 as well as possible implications in understanding adhesion in other animals.

\begin_layout Standard
Normal adhesion force measurements on a restrained leg of a live ladybug
 beetle were performed.
 We characterize adhesion by the pull-off force during detachment.
 Measurements were done against smooth glass and fluorinated surfaces to
 represent hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates respectively.
 When no water was present, we labeled the contact type as

 For the underwater conditions, measurements were done both in the presence
 and absence of a trapped bubble (

 Adhesion force for each of the labeled contact types were compared for
 both substrates.

\begin_layout Standard
Seven-spotted adult ladybug beetles (
\emph on
Coccinella septempuctata
\emph default
) purchased from Katz Biotech (Baruth, Germany) were used for adhesion tests.
 The beetles were housed in a plastic box filled with leaves, twigs and
 stones at room temperature and 60-80% relative humidity with daily access
 to sunlight.
 The beetles were fed with raisins, honey and water

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiments were done on male beetles.
 Each leg of the beetle has a pair of hairy pads covered with mostly discoidal
 shaped setae, capable of strong adhesion.
 For the test, we only allowed the distal-end pad to make contact.
 The beetle's leg was constrained similar to the method described by Bullock
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A steel ball fixed with a piece of thick solder wire served as a rotatable
 holder to fix the beetle and align its leg (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Setup"
plural "false"

).
 The beetle was first anesthetized using CO

\end_inset

 sublimating from a piece of dry ice and then glued to the steel ball on
 its back.
 Its front left leg was carefully fixed to the solder wire using Blue-Tac.
 Its claws were fixed using epoxy glue to prevent any wiggling.
 The leg was aligned such that only the distal pad of its leg can make contact.
 A small piece of non-sticky Teflon tape helped to keep its other legs tucked
 close to the body to minimize their interference during the adhesion test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After measurements, the beetle was freed by carefully removing the epoxy
 glue and Blue-Tac without harming it using a pair of tweezers and set free.

Substrate preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard 20 mm wide glass coverslips were used as the hydrophilic substrate.
 Glass was wiped with isopropanol, rinsed in water and dried under nitrogen
 flow.
 The surface was then plasma cleaned in oxygen plasma chamber (Diener Electronic
 Femto) for 10 mins at 120 W.
 The surface was further rinsed with water and dried under nitrogen flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the hydrophobic substrate, the glass cover slip was coated with a fluorosila
ne via chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
 The glass was first cleaned using IPA and plasma treated as before.
 0.2 ml of Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (PFOTS), procured
 from Sigma Aldrich, was put in a sealed chamber along with the the cleaned
 glass cover slip.
 The chamber was placed under 100 mbar pressure for 10 mins for the CVD
 process.
 The glass substrates were finally annealed at 150â for 3 hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The substrate wettability was characterized by dynamic contact angle measurement
s performed with a DataPhysics OCA 35 contact angle goniometer using water
 and n-hexadecane.
 Advancing and receding contact angles were measured for a maximum drop
 volume of 10 Î¼l and with 0.5 Î¼l/s flow rate.
 Static contact angles were measured for a 5 Î¼l drop.

Field desorption mass spectroscopy

\begin_layout Standard
Field Desorption Mass Spectrometry (FDMS) measurements of the adhesive fluid
 secretions were performed using ZAB 2-SE-FPD spectrometer (VG Instruments).
 A previous study on archanids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN223"

\end_inset

 reported that the secreted fluid does not dissolve away in water.
 To confirm this for the beetle, measurements before and after the immersion
 of its legs in water were done.
 The middle leg of an Asian ladybird (
\emph on
Harmonia axyridis
\emph default
) was immersed in 50 ÂµL THF for 20 m and then transferred to the measurement
 chamber of the FDMS.
 As a reference, pure THF was used.
 The second middle leg of the same ladybird was immersed in 100 ÂµL milli-Q
 water for 15 minutes, then in THF for 20 minutes and then transferred to
 the measurement chamber of the FDMS.
 Molecular composition was extracted from the peak positions of the FDMS
 data.

Adhesion test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adhesion measurements were performed on a custom force measurement setup
 developed in-house (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 A fiber optic displacement sensor (
\emph on
Philtec D20, PHILTEC, Inc.
 USA
\emph default
) together with a steel bending beam (spring constant = 68.1 N/m) constitutes
 the vertical force sensor.
 Beam deflection was calibrated using 4 different known weights to get the
 corresponding force.
 A plastic 3D printed substrate holder was glued to the end of the bending
 beam.
 The holder was designed to allow switching from one substrate to another
 without removing any glue.
 It also had transparent side walls which allowed us to fill it with water
 for the underwater experiments.
 The sensor was mounted on a stage consisting of a X-piezo, used for precise
 lateral movements, XYZ motors, for coarse movements and goniometer, for
 adjusting substrate alignment with the optics.
 Additionally, a separate Z-piezo, fixed upright, was used for vertical
 up-down motion, bringing the insect in contact with the substrate from
 the top.
 A 3 axis manual micro-manipulator together with a free stainless steel
 ball allowed good alignment of the beetle's foot to the substrate.
 A coaxial illuminated tube microscope (
\emph on
Navitar
\emph default
) with 2x objective and a stereo-microscope with 1x objective (
\emph on
Wild Heerbrugg
\emph default
) fit with cameras were used to record the sample contact with the substrate
 from ventral and side views respectively.
 Pad contact area was visualized in total reflection mode by the ventral
 view camera.
 The data acquisition from the force sensor and cameras, together with the
 appropriate piezo motion steps were synchronized using a custom LABVIEW
 program.
 Force data was acquired at a sample rate of 984 Hz, averaged to 512 points
 per motion step.
 Videos were recorded at 20 frames per second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vertical and lateral piezos were together used to perform approach-retract
 adhesion tests with the substrate to get the pull-off force.
 However, instead of a simple down-up motion some additional motion steps
 were included (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Setup"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A 100 Î¼m lateral sliding motion was done after the initial approach step
 to give a proximal pull to the beetle's leg and thus properly orient its
 hairs with the substrate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN19"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 An additional 10 Î¼m compression step (approach) was done to ensure all
 hairs are loaded in compression and make good contact with the surface.
 A short pause (1 s) was introduced to minimize any viscoelastic effects
 before finally retracting the leg away from the substrate.
 All approach, retract and lateral slide motion was done at a speed of 62.5
 Î¼m/s.
 Ventral view video recordings were used for contact area extraction while
 the side view imaging was used to visually aid orienting the pad with the
 substrate before a test.

 also shows a typical measurement recording, where force and contact area
 are plotted as a function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For underwater experiments, 1 ml deionized water was pipetted into the substrate
 holder.
 In order to achieve an underwater contact without a trapped air bubble,
 the water was first degassed in a vacuum chamber for 3 hours and used immediate
ly.
 Before experiment, the pad was repeatedly brought into contact with the
 surface 10 times to equilibriate the pad system.
 5 force measurements were subsequently performed on a fresh spot of the
 substrate and averaged for data analysis.
 Experiments were repeated with 5 individual beetles for each type of contact
 and substrate.
 In total, 30 beetles were tested.

 of force data and video recordings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For measurements in air, pull-off force was defined as the minimum negative
 force during the final retraction step.
 For underwater measurements, an additional correction was needed.
 When the beetle was submerged underwater, its contact line at the water
 surface shifted, which influenced the force readout due to surface tension
 effects.
 This effect needed to be canceled.
 So, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

background
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 force data was recorded where the submerged beetle makes no contact with
 the substrate.
 This background data was then subtracted from a typical force data with
 substrate contact to correct for the external surface tension effects.
 After this, the pull-off force was calculated from the minima as before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data sets were compared for statistical differences using pairwise Student
 t-test and their corresponding p-value and Common Language Effect Size
 (CLES) are reported.
 Shapiro-Wilk test was done for each data set to verify a normal distribution
 of its residuals and Levene's test was done to check for variance homogeneity,
 to validate the t-test assumptions.
 Bonferroni's correction was used to account for multiple comparison between
 groups.

Molecular weights of the secreted fluid mixtures extracted from an Asian

).
 Except for two molecular weights (406.8 g/mol and 331.6 g/mol), the chemical
 fingerprint remained unchanged, indicating that the lipid mixture was not
 washed away underwater.
 Probable compounds in the fluid, corresponding to the resultant molecular
 weights, include aliphatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes.

).
 In air, there is no significant difference in the adhesion force between
 glass and PFOTS substrate (p = 0.959).
 Underwater however, when there is no trapped bubble, adhesion on a PFOTS
 surface is significantly larger than on glass (p < 0.001).
 On PFOTS, there is no significant difference in the adhesion force in air
 or underwater conditions.
 But on glass, adhesion in air is significantly larger than underwater,
 either in the presence (p = 0.002) or absence (p < 0.011) of the bubble.
 At the same, we see that the presence of the bubble results in a higher
 adhesion force than with no bubble (CLES = 0.84), although the difference
 is not statistically significant (p = 0.07).

Single leg adhesion force measurements of ladybug beetle (

 Values represent peak force of a distal pad pulled off from each substrate
 at 62.5 Î¼m/s retraction speed.
 Three types of contact are seen in underwater experiments and are represented

Apart from the three predicted contact types, we also observed an additional
 fourth type of contact which sometimes occurs underwater, labeled as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
bad contact
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 In this scenario, the hairs don't appear to make a perfect contact with
 the substrate, unlike the other three contact types.

 shows no adhesion with either glass or PFOTS substrate.
 While it's not completely clear why such a contact occurs, there can be
 two possible reasons.
 First, the hairs could get bundled due to a small air meniscus inside the
 hairs, resulting in its disorientation.
 Second, a thin water layer at the substrate interface might not be drained
 out to allow the hairs to make contact with the substrate, resulting in
 a loss of adhesion.

We modeled the hairy pad as an array of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 cylindrical rods of length, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, and diameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{h}$
\end_inset

, fixed to a flat circular pad of diameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{p}$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 For simplicity, we assume both hairs and the pad to be perfectly rigid.
 The tip of each cylindrical hair has an adhesive fluid of volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}$
\end_inset

, making contact with the substrate.
 The fluid is assumed to be pinned to the circumference of the hair and
 forms a capillary bridge of height, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, with the substrate.
 We consider three types of contacts as seen in our experiments with the
 beetle: 1) 
\emph on
In air
\emph default
, 2) 
\emph on
Underwater: no bubble
\emph default
 and 3) 
\emph on
Underwater: bubble

 In the third case, a bubble of volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{b}$
\end_inset

, is trapped between the hairs and pinned to the pad circumference.

The capillary bridge model.
 The hairs makes contact with the substrate in three ways: a) 
\emph on

, where the adhesive fluid bridges are surrounded by air; b) 
\emph on
Underwater: no bubble
\emph default
, where the adhesive fluid bridges are fully surrounded by water; c)

 are outside in water.

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}=\frac{4}{3}\pi s_{f}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{b}=\frac{4}{3}\pi s_{b}^{3}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{b}$
\end_inset

 are the radii of spheres with equivalent volumes.
 Fluid and bubble radii are assumed to scale proportional to their corresponding
 pinned contact diameter.
 We thus define the size parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{f}=D_{h}/\left(2s_{f}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{b}=D_{p}/\left(2s_{b}\right)$

 for the fluid and bubble respectively, to conveniently scale their sizes
 relative to the hair and pad diameters they are pinned to.

The net force for cases 1 and 2 can be calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the capillary force of a single fluid bridge at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For case 3, the net force is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{net}=N_{in}f_{air}+N_{out}f_{water}+f_{bubble}\label{eq:f_bubble}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{in}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{out}$
\end_inset

 are the number of hairs inside and outside the bubble respectively.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{air}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{water}$
\end_inset

 are the capillary forces of a fluid bridge at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 inside and outside the bubble surrounded by air and water respectively
 , and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{bubble}$
\end_inset

 is the capillary force contribution due to the bubble meniscus alone at
 distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d+L$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capillary force, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, is the sum of two contributions: surface tension and Laplace pressure.
 Force versus distance for a single capillary bridge is calculated by Surface
 Evolver simulations, described in appendix (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Simulation-Method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and used to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{net}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 for each type of contact.
 The adhesion force of the full hairy pad system is then obtained from the
 minima of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{net}$
\end_inset

, where negative force values represent attraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have considered 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{air}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{water}$
\end_inset

 to be distinct terms because the capillary force by the adhesive fluid
 will be different in air and water due to its different contact angle and
 interfacial tension in each case.
 Using the Young-DuprÑ equations, one can derive the following relation
 for the contact angle of the adhesive fluid underwater:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta_{fw}=\frac{\gamma_{fa}\cos\theta_{fa}-\gamma_{wa}\cos\theta_{wa}}{\gamma_{fw}}\label{eq:theta_fw}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{fw}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{fa}$
\end_inset

 are the contact angles of the adhesive fluid with the substrate in water
 and air respectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{wa}$
\end_inset

 is the contact angle of water with the substrate in air, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fa}$
\end_inset

 is the surface tension of the adhesive fluid, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{wa}$
\end_inset

 is the surface tension of water and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fw}$
\end_inset

 is the interfacial tension of the adhesive fluid with water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All lengths are normalized w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{f}$
\end_inset

 and forces are normalized w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fa}s_{f}$
\end_inset

.
 Interfacial tension values are fixed relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fa}$
\end_inset

.
 Non dimensional bubble volume is expressed as, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}=V_{b}/s_{f}^{3}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

 We consider representative hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{fa}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{wa}$
\end_inset

 values corresponding to a typical glass and fluorinated surface, respectively.
 We assume the adhesive fluid to be an oil-lke substance and thus the interfacia

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{wa}/\gamma_{fa}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fw}/\gamma_{fa}$

Capillary force of a pinned liquid bridge
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forces due to a single pinned capillary liquid bridge in contact with a
 substrate are obtained via simulations (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Single-bridge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Capillary forces are more attractive for smaller contact angles.
 The Laplace pressure contribution to the net adhesion force dominates for
 contact angles less than 100Â° (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Single-bridge"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

b).
 Interestingly, its contribution to the adhesion force is mostly non-repulsive
 for contact angles greater than 90Â°.
 This is because the low volume of fluid and pinned contact line prevents
 the fluid bridge from having a high positive curvature due to geometric
 constraints.
 Only for a contact angle of 150Â°, the fluid curvature becomes positive,
 manifested in its slightly repulsive Laplace contribution.
 Surface tension makes a significant contribution to the net force only
 for a small range of contact angles close to 90Â°.
 For contact angles greater than 150Â°, the net adhesion force approaches
 zero.
 We see that generally, the shape of the fluid bridge determines the strength
 of its adhesion force.
 High adhesion is thus seen for contact angles less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 70Â° due to a net negative curvature of the fluid shape, while low adhesion
 is seen for contact angles greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 150Â° due to its net curvature being close to zero.

a).
 This is a result of the pinned contact line constraint.
 A limited volume is available for the fluid to occupy when the gap distance
 is small, causing the fluid shape to bulge outward near the pinned contact
 line.
 This creates a net positive curvature, resulting in a positive Laplace
 pressure and thus repulsion.

 (Figure

 Rest of the parameters are kept constant (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

) to make a direct comparison of the effect of contact type and substrate
 chemistry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the hydrophilic substrate (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{wa}=24\textdegree$
\end_inset

), contact in air shows the highest adhesion.
 
\emph on
Underwater: no bubble
\emph default
 shows close to no adhesion while 
\emph on
underwater: bubble
\emph default
 shows moderate adhesion.
 In contrast, for a hydrophobic substrate (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{wa}=120\textdegree$
\end_inset

), the highest adhesion is seen for 
\emph on
underwater: no bubble
\emph default
, much larger than 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
.
 Even 
\emph on
underwater: bubble
\emph default
 has slightly higher adhesion than 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
.
 Note that the contact area is fixed by keeping the area fraction and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{p}/D_{h}$
\end_inset

 constant.
 All curves correspond to the same total hair contact area.
 The above effects can thus be attributed solely to how the the capillary
 force changes for each type of contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a hydrophilic substrate, the contact angle of the oily adhesive fluid
 is 6Â° (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Model-parameters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

) when surrounded by air and 150Â° when surrounded by water (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:theta_fw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This results in the capillary bridge shape having a net negative and slightly
 positive curvatures respectively (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Oil-contact-images"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), resulting in strong adhesion in air and poor adhesion underwater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a hydrophobic substrate however, the contact angles of the fluid in air
 and water are 50Â° and 1Â°, respectively.
 In both cases, the contact angles are low, resulting in strong adhesion
 in both media.
 Additionally, the interfacial tension of the oily fluid underwater (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fw}$
\end_inset

) is twice that of in air (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fa}$
\end_inset

 Thus, we see a higher adhesion for 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
The net force in the 
\emph on
underwater: bubble
\emph default
 case mainly depends on the proportion of hairs inside or outside the bubble
 (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:f_bubble"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For the given bubble volume, only part of the hairs are inside the bubble
 for the hydrophilic substrate while all the hairs are inside the bubble
 for the hydrophobic substrate.
 Therefore, its force curve lies between 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
underwater: no bubble
\emph default
 cases for a hydrophilic substrate, and closely follows the 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
 case for a hydrophobic substrate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of capillary force due to the bubble is negligible for
 both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-substrate"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Its contribution even is slightly repulsive on the hydrophilic substrate
 due to the positive curvature of the bubble, and slightly attractive on
 the hydrophobic substrate due to its negative curvature.
 This small contribution is manifested by the slightly higher adhesion for
 
\emph on
underwater: bubble
\emph default
 relative to 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
 for the hydrophobic substrate, where all hairs are within the bubble.

Capillary Bridge Model: Effect of hair diameter 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of changing hair diameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{h}$
\end_inset

, to the net adhesion force is compared for hydrophilic and hydrophobic
 substrates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-hair"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Here, the pad diameter, total hair contact area and bubble volume are constant
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{p}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

 are fixed.
 The radius corresponding to the fluid volume is assumed to scale proportional
 to the hair diameter it is pinned to (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{f}=2$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adhesion force increases with decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{h}$
\end_inset

 for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates in all contact types.
 This is consistent with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

contact splitting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 theory, which predicts higher adhesion when the contact is split into many
 small contact points
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN24"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Reducing the hair diameter results in two competing effects: 1) capillary
 force due to a single fluid bridge decreases due to its smaller size and
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-similar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scaling assumption, which decreases the net force, and 2) total number
 of fluid bridges increases since the total hair contact area is assumed
 to be fixed, which increases the net force.
 The second effect dominates, resulting in higher adhesion force as 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{h}$
\end_inset

 decreases.

The bubble's contribution gets repulsive as hair diameter decreases for
 both substrates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-hair"
plural "false"

 Since the aspect ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $L/D_{h}$
\end_inset

 is fixed (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Model-parameters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), decreasing the hair diameter also decreases its length.
 The bubble has less space available between the pad and the substrate,
 resulting in it bulging outwards near the pinned contact line on top.
 Thus, the bubble's contribution at fixed volume gets repulsive as hair
 diameter decreases.
\end_layout

Capillary Bridge Model: Effect of bubble volume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of varying bubble volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

, on the net adhesion force of the 
\emph on

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-bubble"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 From previous sections, we know that on the hydrophilic substrate, fluid
 bridges outside the bubble has negligible contribution due to its positive
 curvature.
 Thus, decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

 decreases adhesion force due to a larger proportion of hairs outside the
 bubble.
 In contrast, on the hydrophobic substrate, fluid bridges outside the bubble
 have stronger contribution to the net capillary force, due to its low contact
 angle and high interfacial tension in water.
 Thus, adhesion force increases for a hydrophobic substrate as the bubble
 size decreases.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

The contribution of the bubble to the net adhesion force is small regardless
 of its size.
 We see that a smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

 results in increased attraction by the bubble on both types of substrates.
 For larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

, force trend for the whole pad mostly follows that of the bubble, because
 the bubble in this case is big enough to entrap all hairs inside it.
 Thus, the force contribution due to the fluid bridges remain unchanged,
 while the bubble's contribution increases slightly as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

 increases.
 Once the bubble is small enough such that part of the fluid bridges start
 making contact in water, the force trend changes with a steep decrease
 (increase) in adhesion force on hydrophilic (hydrophobic) substrate as
 the volume decreases.
 In all cases, the bubble's adhesion force is much smaller when compared
 to the whole pad.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that the ladybug beetle
 can attach underwater to a hydrophobic substrate even without a bubble
 trapped around its hairs.
 A previous study
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN87"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 had hypothesized that the bubble is necessary for underwater attachment
 in beetles.
 This is, however, only true for hydrophilic substrates, where a trapped
 bubble can facilitate underwater adhesion due to the hairs making contact
 in a dewetted environment.
 For a hydrophobic substrate, the adhesion is similar regardless of whether
 the contact occurs in air or underwater conditions, with or without a trapped
 bubble.
 Our theoretical calculations further show that the bubble by itself has
 a negligible capillary contribution to the net adhesion of the pad underwater.
 Direct force measurement of a single similarly sized bubble making contact
 with a hydrophobic substrate shows a maximum adhesion less than 50 Î¼N,
 which further validates that the bubble's contribution is insignificant
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Capillary-force-due"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Predictions of adhesion force from the capillary bridge model follow the
 experimental results (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-contact"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In underwater conditions without a trapped bubble, adhesion on a hydrophobic
 substrate is significantly larger than on a hydrophilic substrate.
 This is explained by the different oil contact angles and its interfacial
 tension for the substrates in air and underwater, which influences the
 capillary adhesive force in each case (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Oil-contact-images"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the measurements don't show the predicted 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 2.6 times increase in underwater adhesion relative to that in air on the
 hydrophobic PFOTS surface.
 This discrepancy could be due to our assumptions of the oily fluid's interfacia
l properties.

\begin_inset Formula $\sim$

 1.7, closer to our experimental value of

 1.
 The resulting change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{fa}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{fw}$

 will further decrease this number.
 Direct measurement of the fluid's interfacial properties is thus essential
 to better predict the insect's adhesion, and will be a subject of future
 study.
 Further, due to surface inhomogeneities, all the hairs might not be able
 to completely drain the interfacial water layer, in order for the fluid
 to make a direct contact with the substrate.
 This can further reduce underwater adhesion, in comparison to our theoretical
 predictions which assumes a perfect contact.

In the model, we assume that all the hairs detach simultaneously to give
 a theoretical maximum achievable adhesion force.
 Our experimental conditions, however, differ from such assumptions.
 The pad always makes contact with the substrate at a random orientation,
 which is difficult to control precisely.
 During detachment, the pad typically peels off from its proximal to distal
 end rather than detach simultaneously.
 Our model also assumes the hairs to be of similar geometry, unlike the
 beetle's pad which has a distribution of flat or pointed tipped hairs.
 Thus, it's not surprising that the model overestimates the adhesion forces.
 The predictions are however in the same order of magnitude as experiments,
 and the qualitative trend is consistent for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
 substrates in air and underwater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study provides further validation that capillary forces by the adhesive
 fluid control insect adhesion and van der Waals contribution, if any, must
 be negligible.
 Further, the same capillary forces can even enable adhesion underwater
 depending on the substrate chemistry.
 Underwater without a trapped bubble, the pad adheres strongly to a hydrophobic
 substrate, but poorly to a hydrophilic substrate, even though it shows
 similarly strong adhesion to both substrates in air.
 This behavior can only be explained by capillary forces.
 Our preliminary FDMS results further provides validation to our assumption
 that the adhesive fluid can form capillary bridges with the substrate underwate
r, instead of getting washed away (Table

The findings can also be extended to other animals relying on oily secretions
 for adhesion.
 Ants for example show similar adhesion on hydrophobic substrates under
 wet and dry conditions

 Recent adhesion experiments on geckos reveal that they can attach well
 to fluoropolymer substrates underwater while they show little adhesion
 to the same substrate in air

 Geckos are thought to rely on van der Waals forces via dry contact with
 the substrate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN202"

\end_inset

, although recent observations of phospholipid footprints left behind walking
 geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN205"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 could change that picture.
 Since geckos adhere poorly to PTFE (surface energy ~ 20 mN/m) one can speculate
 that the phospholipid material has a higher surface energy, and consequently
 makes a higher contact angle with PTFE in air.
 Let us assume the phosopholipid substance to be a fluid similar to oil
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fa}$
\end_inset

=30 mN/m and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{fw}$
\end_inset

= 42 mN/m such that its contact angle with PTFE is 80Â°.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:theta_fw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 then gives us an underwater contact angle of 70Â° for the phospholipid fluid.
 Thus, the capillary bridge model can predict a higher adhesion underwater
 than in air with PTFE due to its lower contact angle and higher interfacial
 energy underwater.
 Based on similar assumptions, we predict the net adhesion force for a gecko
 on different substrates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison-with-model"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The adhesion force predictions are in good qualitative agreement with the
 whole animal experimental shear force values reported for the gecko, with
 the trend of higher adhesion in air than underwater for glass, similar
 adhesion in air and underwater for PMMA/OTS-SAM and lower adhesion in air
 than underwater for PTFE.
 We, thus, propose that the underwater experiments performed on geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 are an indirect proof of capillary contributions to gecko adhesion in this

We have so far limited our analysis to only smooth substrates.
 Insects in the real world, however, interact with rough substrates very
 often.
 Previous studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN136"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have shown that substrate roughness is a more dominant parameter than substrate
 chemistry in controlling insect adhesion.
 Future work will explore how roughness can impact the net capillary force
 as given by our model.
 Our study can have potential applications in the design of bio-inspired
 materials to achieve adhesion via capillary bridges.
 Bubble can possibly be used to control underwater adhesion by changing
 the relative proportion of the arrays inside and outside the bubble.
 A suitable choice of adhesive fluid can be made tailored to the substrate
 and environment of application for optimal adhesion performance.
 Future studies on insect adhesion should characterize oleophilicity rather
 than hydrophilicity of a substrate, since oil contact angle primarily controls
 its adhesion to the substrate.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study illustrates that the ladybug beetle relies primarily on its oily
 adhesive fluid secretion to achieve adhesion in both air and underwater
 conditions.
 We show that the beetle can attach underwater on a hydrophobic substrate
 even without a trapped air bubble within its hairy pad, although it loses
 this ability on a hydrophilic substrate.
 The different contact angle and interfacial tension of the adhesive fluid
 in air and underwater conditions explain this observation.
 Theoretical calculations suggest that the bubble itself has a negligible
 capillary contribution to the total force.
 The trapped bubble can promote adhesion only on a hydrophilic substrate
 by providing an air medium to the adhesive fluid bridges inside it.
 Insect adhesion is thus correlated directly to the wettability of the adhesive
 fluid on a given substrate and surrounding medium.
 A similar argument also explains previously reported measurements in geckos
