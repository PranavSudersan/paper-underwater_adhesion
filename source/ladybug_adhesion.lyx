\begin_layout Abstract
Insects like beetles can stick to various surfaces using hairy pads mediated
 by an oily adhesive fluid.
 It was previously shown, the pads can even attach underwater, presumably
 due to an air bubble trapped around the pad.
 However, the bubble's relative contribution to adhesion via capillary force
 remains unclear.
 To investigate the exact role of bubble, in this study, we perform
\emph on
 in-vivo
\emph default
 underwater adhesion measurements of a ladybug pad in the presence and absence
 of trapped bubble and compare it with adhesion in air.
 Our experiments reveal that on a hydrophobic substrate, even without a
 bubble, the pad can show adhesion underwater comparable to that in air.
 Only on a hydrophilic substrate, a trapped bubble is necessary to aid adhesion
 underwater.
 To explain these results, we develop a simple theoretical model to estimate
 the net adhesion of a hairy pad due to capillary forces.
 Our results demonstrate that capillary forces in insects are primarily
 governed by the shape of the adhesive fluid and can help explain its adhesion
 both in both air and underwater conditions.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The question of how insects can walk on smooth surfaces against gravity
 has fascinated scientists for at least the past three centuries

\end_inset

.
 We now know that such animals are able to adhere by using specialized organs
 on their feet called adhesive pads.
 These adhesive pads exist in a variety of types depending on the animal,
 but are generally categorized into: 1)

smooth pads

hairy pads

, geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and others.
 The hairy pads show: 1) compliance to rough surfaces due to their lower
 effective modulus, 2) angle dependent adhesion due to asymmetric hair geometry
 and 3) self-cleaning capability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

, which makes it suitable to adhere to most surfaces reversibly.
 Many of these insects pads also secrete an adhesive fluid as seen in flies
 and ants

 relies mostly on van der Waals forces

Terrestrial beetles such as the dock beetle or ladybug have hairy pads consistin
g of a dense array of hair like structures called setae.
 The setae tips can be discoidal, spatula or pointed shaped, which are distribut
ed throughout the pad depending on sex or species

 Single seta force measurements revealed that discoidal shaped seta shows
 larger pull-off force than spatula and pointed setae
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, illustrating the role of hair geometry in adhesion.
 The tip of each seta secretes approximately one femtoliter oily adhesive
 fluid 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
While most of the studies on insect adhesion are done under natural conditions
 in air, insect attachment underwater has been relatively unexplored.
 Typically, underwater adhesion is complicated to achieve due to the difficulty
 in displacing the water layer and enable good contact 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN123"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Regardless, a study on leaf beetles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN87"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has revealed that beetles can attach well to surfaces underwater.
 Its hairy pad traps an air bubble underwater, which dewets the surface
 on contact.
 It has been hypothesized that a combination of capillary forces due the
 air bubble and hair contact within the dewetted area results in attachment.
 However, a detailed investigation of the bubble's contribution and necessity
 to adhere to different surfaces is lacking.
 Geckos are also known to adhere underwater, where its shear adhesion force
 on hydrophobic substrates are similar in both air and underwater conditions.
 Interestingly, its adhesion on a fluorinated substrate is even larger underwate
r than in air
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN15"

\end_inset

.
 This has been partially explained by a thermodynamic work of adhesion model,
 assuming full displacement of water at the interface, leading to dry contact
 of hairs with the surface

The goal of this paper is to provide a generalized picture of adhesion in
 insects using hairy pads secreting a fluid for attachment.
 First, we perform adhesion measurements of a single constrained pad of
 a live ladybug beetle in air and underwater conditions on smooth hydrophilic
 and hydrophobic glass surfaces, with a microscopic observation of the contact
 process.
 Second, we develop a simple theoretical model considering capillary forces
 to predict the net adhesion force of a hairy pad under different conditions.
 Finally, we discuss key insights gained from our experiments and model
 as well as possible implications in understanding adhesion in other animals.

Experimental

\begin_layout Standard
Normal adhesion force measurements on a restrained leg of a live ladybug
 beetle were performed.
 We characterize adhesion by the pull-off force during detachment.
 Measurements were done against smooth glass and fluorinated surfaces to
 represent hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates respectively.
 When no water is present, we labeled the contact type as

 For the underwater conditions, measurements were done both in the presence
 and absence of a trapped bubble (

, respectively) to investigate the bubble's role in underwater adhesion.
 Adhesion force for each of the labeled contact types are compared for both
 substrates.

\begin_layout Standard
Seven-spotted adult ladybug beetles (
\emph on
Coccinella septempuctata
\emph default
) purchased from Katz Biotech (Baruth, Germany) were used for adhesion tests.
 The beetles were housed in a plastic box filled with leaves, twigs and
 stones under at room temperature and 60-80% relative humidity with daily
 access to sunlight.
 The beetles were fed with raisins, honey and water

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiments were done on male beetles.
 Each leg of the beetle has a pair of hairy pads covered with mostly discoidal
 shaped setae, capable of strong adhesion.
 For the test, we only allow the distal-end pad to make contact.
 The beetle's leg was constrained similar to the method described by Bullock
 et al

 A steel ball fixed with a piece of thick solder wire serves as a rota-table
 holder to fix the beetle and align its leg (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The beetle was first anesthetized using CO

 sublimating from a piece of dry ice and glued to the steel ball on its
 back.
 Its front left leg was carefully fixed to the solder wire using Blue-Tac.
 Its claws were fixed using epoxy glue to prevent any wiggling.
 The leg was aligned such that only the distal pad of its leg can make contact.
 A small piece of non-sticky Teflon tape helped to keep its other legs tucked
 close to the body to minimize interference during the measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After measurements, the beetle was freed by carefully removing the epoxy
 glue and Blue-Tac without harming it using a pair of tweezers and set free.

Substrate preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard 20 mm wide glass coverslips are used as the hydrophilic substrate.
 Glass was wiped with isopropanol, rinsed in water and dried under nitrogen
 flow.
 The surface was then plasma cleaned in oxygen plasma chamber (Diener Electronic
 Femto) for 10 mins at 120 W.
 The surface was further rinsed with water and dried under nitrogen flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the hydrophobic substrate, the glass cover slip was coated with a fluorosila
ne via chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
 The glass was first cleaned using IPA and plasma treated as before.
 0.2 ml of Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (PFOTS), procured
 from Sigma Aldrich, was put in a sealed chamber along with the the glass
 cover slip.
 The chamber was placed under 100 mbar pressure for 10 mins for the CVD
 process.
 The glass substrates were finally annealed at 150â for 3 hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The substrate wettability was characterized by dynamic contact angle measurement
s performed with a DataPhysics OCA 35 contact angle goniometer using water
 and n-hexadecane.
 Advancing and receding contact angles were measured for a maximum drop
 volume of 10 Î¼l and with 0.5 Î¼l/s flow rate.
 Static contact angles were measured for a 5 Î¼l drop.

\begin_layout Standard
Field Desorption Mass Spectrometry (FDMS) measurements of the adhesive fluid
 secretions were performed using ZAB 2-SE-FPD spectrometer (VG Instruments).
 A previous study on archanids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 reported that the secreted fluid does not dissolve away in water.
 To confirm this for the beetle, measurements before and after the immersion
 of its legs in water were done.
 The middle leg of an Asian ladybird (
\emph on
Harmonia axyridis
\emph default
) was immersed in 50 ÂµL THF for 20 m and then transferred to the measurement
 chamber of the FDMS.
 As a reference, pure THF was used.
 The second middle leg of the same ladybird was immersed in 100 ÂµL milli-Q
 water for 15 minutes, then in THF for 20 minutes and then transferred to
 the measurement chamber of the FDMS.
 Molecular composition is extracted from the peak positions of the FDMS
 data.

Adhesion test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adhesion measurements were performed on a custom force measurement setup
 developed in-house (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 A fiber optic displacement sensor (Philtec D20, PHILTEC, Inc.
 USA) together with a steel bending beam (spring constant = 68.1 N/m) constitutes
 the vertical force sensor.
 Beam deflection was calibrated using 4 different known weights to get the
 corresponding force.
 A plastic 3D printed substrate holder was glued to the end of the bending
 beam.
 The holder was designed to allow switching from one substrate to another
 without removing any glue.
 It also had transparent side walls which allowed us to fill it with water
 for the underwater experiments.
 The sensor was mounted on a stage consisting of a X-piezo used for precise
 lateral movements, XYZ motors for coarse movements and goniometer for adjusting
 substrate alignment with the optics.
 Additionally, a separate Z-piezo fixed upright is used for vertical up-down
 motion, bringing the specimen in contact with the substrate from top.
 A 3 axis manual micro-manipulator together with a free stainless steel
 ball allowed good alignment of the beetle's foot to the substrate.
 A coaxial illuminated tube microscope (Navitar) with 2x objective and a
 stereo-microscope with 1x objective (Wild Heerbrugg) fit with cameras are
 used to record the sample contact with the substrate from bottom and side
 views respectively.
 Pad contact area was visualized in total reflection mode by the ventral
 view camera.
 The data acquisition from the force sensor and cameras together with an
 appropriate piezo motion steps are synchronized using a custom LABVIEW
 program.
 Force data was acquired at a sample rate of 984 Hz, averaged to 512 points
 per motion step.
 Videos were recorded at 20 frames per second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vertical and lateral piezos were together used to perform approach-retract
 adhesion tests with the substrate to get the pull-off force.
 However, instead of a simple down-up motion some additional motion steps
 were included (Figure

 b).
 A 100 Î¼m lateral sliding motion was done after the initial approach step
 to give a proximal pull to the beetle's leg and thus properly orient its
 hairs with the substrate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN19"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 An additional 10 Î¼m compression step (approach) was done to ensure all
 hairs are loaded in compression and make good contact with the surface.
 A short pause (1 s) was introduced to minimize any viscoelastic effects
 before finally retracting the leg away from the substrate.
 All approach, retract and lateral slide was done at a speed of 62.5 Î¼m/s.
 Ventral view video recordings were used for contact area extraction while
 the side view imaging is used only to visually aid orienting the pad with
 the substrate before a test.

 In order to achieve an underwater

 by degassing the water in a vacuum chamber for 3 hours before use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before experiment, the pad was repeatedly brought into contact with the
 surface 10 times to equilibriate the pad system.
 5 force measurements were subsequently performed on a fresh spot of the
 substrate and averaged for data analysis.
 Experiments were repeated with 5 individual beetles for each type of contact
 and substrate.
 In total, 30 beetles were tested.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For measurements in air, pull-off force is defined as the minimum negative
 force during the final retraction step.
 For underwater measurements, an additional correction needs to be done
 first.
 During the piezo motion, contact line of the immersed holder at water surface
 changes, influencing the force readout due to surface tension.
 This effect needs to be canceled.
 So, a background force data is recorded where the submerged beetle makes
 no contact with the substrate.
 The background forces is then subtracted from a typical force data with
 substrate contact to correct for the external surface tension effects.
 After this, the pull-off force is calculated from the minima as before.

Data sets are compared for statistical differences using pairwise t-test
 and their corresponding p-value and CLES effect sizes are reported.
 Shapiro-Wilk test was done for each data set to verify a normal distribution
 of its residuals and Levene's test was done to check for variance homogeneity,
 to validate the t-test assumptions.

 Except from two molecular weights (406.8 g/mol and 331.6 g/mol), the chemical
 fingerprint remained unchanged, indicating stability of the lipid mixture
 underwater.
 Probable molecules, corresponding to the resulting molecular weights, include
 aliphatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes.

).
 In air, there is no significant difference in the adhesion force between
 glass and PFOTS substrate (p = 0.959).
 Underwater however, adhesion on a PFOTS surface is significantly larger
 than on glass when there is no trapped bubble (p < 0.001).
 On PFOTS, there is no significant difference in the adhesion force in air
 or underwater conditions.
 But on glass, adhesion in air is significantly larger than underwater in
 the presence (p = 0.002) or absence (p < 0.011) of the bubble.
 At the same, we see that the presence of bubble results in a higher adhesion
 force than with no bubble (CLES = 0.84), although the difference is not
 statistically significant (p = 0.07).

 In this scenario, the hairs don't appear to make a perfect contact with

 shows no adhesion with either glass or PFOTS substrate.
 While it's not completely clear why such a contact occurs, there can be
 two possible reasons.
 First, the hairs could get bundled due to a small air meniscus inside the
 hairs, resulting in its disorientation.
 Second, the substrate is not dewetted during contact, causing a thin water
 layer on the surface to prevent adhesion.

 For simplicity, we assume both hairs and the pad to be perfectly rigid.
 The tip of each cylindrical hair has an adhesive fluid of volume V

 making contact with the substrate.
 The fluid is assumed to be pinned to the circumference of the hair and
 forms a capillary bridge of height d with the substrate.
 In order to model the contact in both air and underwater conditions, we
 consider three types of contacts as seen in our experiments with the beetle:

 Liquid bridges forming contact with the substrate within the bubble are
 surrounded by air while the ones forming contact outside the bubble are
 surrounded by water.

The capillary force, f is the sum of two contributions: surface tension

 Force versus distance for a single capillary bridge is calculated by numerical
 simulations, described in appendix (

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 The adhesion force of the full hairy pad system is then obtained from the
 minima of the respective force-distance curves.

Capillary force of a pinned liquid bridge
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forces due to a single pinned capillary liquid bridge in contact with a
 substrate are obtained via simulations (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Single-bridge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Capillary forces are more attractive for smaller contact angles.
 The Laplace pressure contribution to the net adhesion force dominates for
 contact angles less than 100Â° (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Single-bridge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b).
 Interestingly, its contribution to adhesion force is mostly non-repulsive
 for contact angles greater than 90Â°.
 This is because the low volume of fluid and pinned contact line prevents
 the fluid bridge from having a high positive curvature due to geometric
 constraints.
 Only for a contact angle of 150Â°, the fluid curvature becomes positive,
 manifested in its slightly repulsive Laplace contribution.
 Surface tension makes a significant contribution to the net force only
 for contact angles greater than 70Â°.
 For contact angles greater than 150Â°, the net adhesive force approaches
 zero.
 Since Laplace pressure is an indicator of the fluid bridge shape, one can
 make a general statement that the shape of the fluid bridge primarily determine
s the strength of its adhesion force for low and high contact angles.
 High adhesion is thus seen for contact angles less than 70Â° due to a net
 negative curvature of the fluid shape, while low adhesion is seen for contact
 angles greater than 150Â° due to its net curvature being close to zero.

 a).
 This is a result of the pinned contact line constraint.
 A limited volume is available for the fluid to occupy when the gap distance
 is small, causing the fluid shape to bulge outward near the pinned contact
 line.
 This creates a net positive curvature, resulting in a positive Laplace
 pressure and thus repulsion.

 Note that the contact area is fixed by keeping the area fraction Î± (Table

 All curves correspond to the same total hair contact area.
 The above effects can thus be attributed solely to how the the capillary

On a hydrophilic substrate, the contact angle of the oily adhesive fluid
 is 6Â° (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:theta_fw"
plural "false"

 This results in the capillary bridge shape having a net negative and slightly
 positive curvatures respectively (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Oil-contact-images"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

).
 Since Laplace contribution controls capillary force at such extreme contact
 angles (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Capillary-force-of"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

), the fluid bridges show strong adhesion in air while underwater, they
 show little to no adhesion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a hydrophobic substrate however, the contact angles of the fluid in air
 and water are 50Â° and 1Â° respectively.
 In both cases, the contact angles are low, resulting in a net attractive
 force in both types of contact.
 Additionally, the interfacial tension of the oily fluid underwater ( Î³

\begin_layout Standard
The net force in the 
\emph on
underwater: bubble
\emph default
 contact mainly depends on the proportion of hairs inside the bubble surrounded
 by air or outside the bubble surrounded by water (see equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:f_bubble"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For the given bubble volume, only part of the hairs are inside the bubble
 for the hydrophilic substrate while all the hairs are inside the bubble
 for the hydrophobic substrate.
 Therefore, its force curve lies in between 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
underwater: no bubble
\emph default
 contact on a hydrophilic substrate, and closely follows that 
\emph on
in air
\emph default
 for a hydrophobic substrate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of capillary force created by the bubble is negligible
 for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-substrate"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Its contribution even is slightly repulsive on the hydrophilic substrate
 due to the positive curvature of the bubble, and slightly attractive on
 the hydrophobic substrate due to its negative curvature.
 The small contribution is manifested by a small downward shift in the 
\emph on
underwater: bubble
\emph default
 contact force curve on hydrophobic substrate.
 Here, all the hairs are trapped inside the bubble and thus its slightly
 higher adhesion relative to air contact is due to the small additional
 contribution of the bubble.

 This is consistent with the

 small contacts points

 Reducing the hair diameter results in two competing effects: 1) capillary
 force due to a single fluid bridge decreases due to its smaller size and

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scaling assumption, which decreases the net force, and 2) total number
 of fluid bridges, N increases since the total hair contact area is assumed
 to be fixed, which increases the net force.
 The net effect results in higher adhesion force as D

 Since the aspect ratio L/D

 The bubble has less space available between the pad and the substrate,
 resulting in it bulging outwards near the pinned contact line on top.
 Thus, bubble contribution gets repulsive as hair diameter decreases if
 bubble volume is kept constant.

 has negligible contribution due to its positive curvature.
 Thus, decreasing

 decreases adhesion force due to the larger proportion of hairs outside
 the bubble.
 In contrast, on the hydrophobic substrate, fluid bridges outside the bubble
 have stronger contribution to the net capillary force due to the low contact
 angle and high interfacial tension in water.
 Thus, adhesion force increases for a hydrophobic substrate as the bubble
 size decreases.

The contribution of the bubble to the net adhesion force is small regardless
 of its size.
 We see that a smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

 results in increased attraction by the bubble in both types of substrates.
 For larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

, force trend for the whole pad mostly follows that of the bubble, because
 the bubble in this case is big enough to entrap all hairs inside it.
 Thus, the force contribution due to the fluid bridges remains unchanged
 while the bubble's contribution increases slightly as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{b}$
\end_inset

 increases.
 Once the bubble becomes small enough and part of the fluid bridges make
 contact in water, the force trend changes with a steep decrease (increase)
 in adhesion force on hydrophilic (hydrophobic) substrate.
 In all cases, the bubble's adhesion force is much smaller when compared
 to the whole pad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, on a hydrophilic substrate, a trapped air bubble in the adhesive
 pad can promote adhesion when its large enough to enclose most of the hairs.
 This allows the hairs to make contact in an air environment.
 This is because wet hairs underwater show no adhesion due to the fluid's
 large contact angle and the only way to achieve adhesion is by maintaining
 the hairs in the air environment provided by the bubble.
 On a hydrophobic substrate, however, a smaller or no bubble enhances adhesion,
 as the bubble has little effect on improving adhesion force.
 Here, hairs making a contact underwater without a trapped bubble show stronger
 adhesion than in air due to the fluid's smaller contact angle and higher
 interfacial tension.
 In either case, the bubble by itself hardly contributes to the net force.
 Despite its large size, the bubble fails to overcome the combined contribution
 of the much smaller fluid bridges to the total force.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that the ladybug beetle
 can attach underwater to a hydrophobic substrate even without a bubble
 trapped around its hairs.
 A previous study
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN87"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 had hypothesized that bubble is necessary for underwater attachment in
 beetles.
 This is, however, only true for hydrophilic substrates, where a trapped
 bubble can facilitate underwater adhesion due to the hairs making contact
 in a dewetted environment.
 For a hydrophobic substrate, the adhesion is similar regardless of whether
 the contact occurs in air or underwater conditions, with or without a trapped
 bubble.
 Our theoretical calculations also show that the bubble by itself has a
 negligible capillary contribution to the net adhesion of the pad underwater.
 Direct force measurement of a single similarly sized bubble making contact
 with a hydrophobic substrate shows a maximum adhesion less than 50 Î¼N,
 which further validates that the bubble's contribution is insignificant
 (see SI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Predictions of adhesion force from the capillary bridge model follow the
 experimental results (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-contact"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In underwater conditions without a trapped bubble, adhesion on a hydrophobic
 substrate is significantly larger than on a hydrophilic substrate.
 This is explained by the different oil contact angles and its interfacial
 tension values for both substrates in air and underwater, which influences
 the capillary adhesive force in each case (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Oil-contact-images"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the measurements don't show the predicted 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 2.6 times increase in underwater adhesion relative to that in air on the
 hydrophobic PFOTS surface.
 This discrepancy could be due to our assumptions of the oily fluid's interfacia
l properties.
 If we choose Î³
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fa
\end_layout

\end_inset

=30 mN/m and Î³
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
wa
\end_layout

\end_inset

=40 mN/m, the corresponding increase in adhesion will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 1.7, closer to our experimental value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 1.
 Direct measurement of the fluid's interfacial properties is thus essential
 to better predict the insect's adhesion, and will be a subject of future
 study.
 Further, due to surface inhomogeneities, all the hairs might not be able
 to completely drain the water layer on the surface, in order for the fluid
 to make a direct contact with the substrate.
 This can further reduce underwater adhesion, in comparison to our theoretical
 predictions which assumes a perfect contact.

\begin_layout Standard
In the model, we assume that all the hairs detach simultaneously to give
 a theoretical maximum achievable adhesion force.
 Our experimental conditions, however, differ from such assumptions.
 The pad always makes contact with the substrate at a random orientation,
 which is difficult to control precisely.
 During detachment, the pad typically peels off from its proximal to distal
 end rather than detach simultaneously.
 Our model also assumes the hairs to be of similar geometry, unlike the
 beetle's pad which has a distribution of flat or pointed tipped hairs.
 Thus, it's not surprising that the model overestimates the adhesion forces.
 The predictions are however in the same order of magnitude as experiments,
 and the qualitative trend is consistent for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
 substrates in air and underwater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study provides further validation that capillary forces by the adhesive
 fluid control insect adhesion and van der Waals contribution, if any, must
 be negligible.
 Further, the same capillary forces can even enable adhesion underwater
 depending on the substrate chemistry.
 Underwater without a trapped bubble, the pad adheres strongly to a hydrophobic
 substrate, but poorly to a hydrophilic substrate, even though it shows
 similarly strong adhesion to both substrates in air.
 This behavior can only be explained by capillary forces.
 Our preliminary FDMS results further provides validation to our assumption
 that the adhesive fluid can form capillary bridges with the substrate underwate
r, instead of getting washed away (Table

The findings can also be extended to other animals relying on oily adhesive
 fluids for adhesion.
 Ants for example show similar adhesion on hydrophobic substrates under
 wet and dry conditions

, similar to what we see in a ladybug.
 Recent adhesion experiments on geckos reveal that they can attach well
 to fluoropolymer substrates underwater while they show little adhesion
 to the same substrate in air

 Geckos are thought to rely on van der Waals forces via dry contact with
 the substrate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN202"

\end_inset

, although recent observations of phospholipid footprints left behind walking
 geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN205"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 could change that picture.
 Since geckos adhere poorly to PTFE (surface energy ~ 20 mN/m) one can speculate
 that the phospholipid material has a higher surface energy, and consequently
 makes a higher contact angle with PTFE in air.
 Let us assume the phosopholipid substance to be a fluid similar to oil
 with Î³
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

= 42 mN/m such that its contact angle with PTFE is 80Â°.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:theta_fw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 then gives us an underwater contact angle of 70Â° for the phospholipid fluid.
 Thus, the capillary bridge model can predict a higher adhesion underwater
 than in air with PTFE due to its lower contact angle and higher interfacial
 energy underwater.
 Based on similar assumptions, we predict the net adhesion force for a gecko
 on different substrates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison-with-model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The adhesion force predictions are in good qualitative agreement with the
 whole animal experimental shear force values reported for the gecko, with
 the trend of higher adhesion in air than underwater for glass, similar
 adhesion in air and underwater for PMMA/OTS-SAM and lower adhesion in air
 than underwater for PTFE.
 We, thus, propose that the underwater experiments performed on geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

We have so far limited our analysis to only smooth substrates.
 Insects in the real world, however, interacts with rough substrates very
 often.
 Previous studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN136"

\end_inset

 have shown that substrate roughness is a more dominant parameter than substrate
 chemistry in controlling insect adhesion.
 Future work will explore how roughness can impact the net capillary force
 as predicted by our model.
 Our study can have potential applications in the design of bio-inspired
 materials to achieve adhesion via capillary bridges.
 Bubble can possibly be used to control underwater adhesion by changing
 the relative proportion of the arrays inside and outside the bubble.
 A suitable choice of adhesive fluid can be made tailored to the substrate
 and environment of application for optimal adhesion performance.
 Future studies on insect adhesion should characterize oleophilicity rather
 than hydrophilicity of a substrate, since oil contact angle primarily controls
 its adhesion to the substrate.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study illustrates that ladybug relies primarily on its oily adhesive
 fluid secretion to achieve adhesion in both air and underwater conditions.
 We show that the beetles can attach underwater on a hydrophobic substrate
 even without a trapped air bubble within its hairy pad, although it loses
 this ability on a hydrophilic substrate.
 The different contact angle and interfacial tension manifested by the adhesive
 fluid in air and underwater conditions explain this observation.
 Theoretical calculations suggest that the bubble itself has a negligible
 capillary contribution to the total force.
 The trapped bubble can promote adhesion only on a hydrophilic substrate
 by providing an air medium to the adhesive fluid bridges inside it.
 Insect adhesion is correlated directly to the shape of the adhesive fluid
 bridge on a given substrate and medium, which is a result of the small
 fluid volume and its contact angle with the substrate.
 A similar argument also explains previously reported measurements in geckos
