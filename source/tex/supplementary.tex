\section{Simulation method: Single capillary bridge \label{subsec:Simulation-Method}}

Capillary force due to a single adhesive fluid or bubble meniscus (termed ``capillary
bridge'') was calculated by performing simulations in Surface Evolver
\cite{RN206}, similar to the method described by \citet{RN93}.
A simple cubic geometry, mimicking the capillary bridge, of constant
volume, $V$, was defined as the initial condition with an interfacial
tension, $\gamma$, with the surrounding medium. Interfacial tension
of the capillary bridge with the substrate is given by $\gamma\cos\theta$,
where $\theta$ is the corresponding contact angle inside the bridge.
For the case of a bubble meniscus, $\theta$ is defined w.r.t. the
surrounding water, since $\theta$ can also directly characterise
the substrate wettability. The capillary bridge spans a gap distance
$d$ between the top face and the substrate. The boundary conditions
were set corresponding to a pinned contact line of diameter $D$ on
the top face and constant interfacial tension with the substrate on
the bottom. All lengths were normalised relative to length $s=\left(3V/4\pi\right)^{1/3}$.
An appropriate geometry refinement routine was chosen to evolve the
capillary bridge shape to its minimum energy state. The normalised
total capillary force, $\hat{f}=f/\gamma s$, is the sum of the Laplace
pressure and surface tension contributions , where:

\begin{equation}
f=f_{laplace}+f_{surface\,tension}=\varDelta P_{laplace}A_{_{bottom}}+2\pi R_{bottom}\gamma\sin\theta\label{eq:f_bridge}
\end{equation}

Here, $\varDelta P_{laplace}$ is the Laplace pressure of the equilibrium
capillary bridge, $A_{bottom}$ is the contact area of the capillary
bridge with the substrate at bottom and $R_{bottom}$ is the corresponding
radius of contact, all obtained from the simulation output for the
equilibrium surface.

The gap distance $d$ was varied stepwise and the capillary force was
calculated each time to obtain force-distance curves for a particular
choice of $D$ and $\theta$. 

%\section{Single capillary bridge: Effect of volume}
%
%Surface Evolver simulation results showing the effect of volume on
%the maximum capillary force of a single fluid bridge. Since the fluid
%is pinned at the top to the same diameter, D, a smaller volume would
%result in high interfacial curvatures, which increases the capillary
%force due to the negative Laplace pressure. In this case, small contact
%angles lead to a greater increase in adhesion.

%\section{Capillary Bridge Model: Effect of hair diameter at constant fluid
%volume}
%
%Here, instead of scaling the fluid volume relative to the hair diameter,
%we now assume a fixed total fluid volume distributed equally among
%the $N$ hairs. Total fluid volume, $V_{total}=NV_{f}=2000$. Hair
%diameter is varied while keeping the total hair contact area constant.
%Length is in arbitrary units. Forces increase at a much smaller rate
%on decreasing diameter when compared to the case with self-similar
%scaling of fluid volume (Figure 8 in main text).

%force-distance curves. Negative force value represents attraction.

\section{Substrate characterization}

The surface chemistry of untreated glass (hydrophilic) and PFOTS-coated glass (hydrophobic) were characterized using dynamic contact angle measurements (Table \ref{tab:Contact-Angles}).

\section{Statistical comparison}

Two-way ANOVA test showed a significant effect of the \emph{Contact mode} (p=0.001, F=9.596, degrees of freedom=2) 
and \emph{Substrate} (p<0.001, F=36.231, degrees of freedom=1) categories on the single leg adhesion force measurements
of the ladybug beetle (\emph{Coccinella septempuctata}). Signifanct interaction between the above two categories was seen (p=0.001, F=10.551, degrees of freedom=2). Post-hoc analysis results are shown below (Table \ref{tab:Statistical-analysis}).
The uncorrected p-values and Common Language Effect Size (CLES) were
obtained from pair-wise Student t-test between A and B while
keeping the third parameter fixed (degrees of freedom=8 for each pair). p-values showing statistically
significant difference between A and B are in boldface. 
CLES represents the statistical proportion of samples under A with higher adhesion than under B. The condition
for statistical significance is based on the Bonferroni-corrected
critical p-value of 0.008.

\section{Capillary force due to an air bubble\label{subsec:Capillary-force-due}}

Capillary force of a single air bubble against a PFOTS-coated glass surface are compared
for two different volumes (Figure \ref{fig:Bubble_capillary_force}). The volumes correspond to the expected
range for the case of the trapped air bubble in a ladybug's pad. Here, the bubble
was pinned to a micropatterned PDMS substrate on the top. Approach-retract tests were performed
at 62.5 \textmu m s\protect\textsuperscript{-1} speed. The maximum
adhesion force of any of the bubble never exceeds 50 \textmu N,
significantly lower than the beetle's underwater adhesion to the same
substrate (> 400 \textmu N). Thus, the bubble's contribution
to adhesion in the ``\emph{underwater: bubble}'' contact of a ladybug's
pad should be negligible. Example measurement video is included in the supplementary data (Movie3).
