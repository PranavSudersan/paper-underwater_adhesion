   Comment = {YES -Order Araneae contains three main spider clades: Araneomorphae, Mygalomorphae, Mesothelae -among Araneomorphae ('true' spiders) major families (1000+ spp) include (all are cosmopolitan): Salticidae: jumping spiders Linyphiidae: dwarf or money spiders, sheet web weavers Araneidae: common orb weavers Theridiidae: cob web weavers Lycosidae: wolf spiders Gnaphosidae: ground spiders Thomisidae: crab spiders -"The family Theraphosidae or "tarantulas" contains almost three times as many species as any other mygalomorph family (ca. 800 species). It is not clear why they are so speciose: the most obvious synapomorphy for the family is dense tarsal scopulae on the last two pairs of legs as well as the first. This feature may aid in locomotion or in prey-handling." -yet another parallel with geckos -Mygalomorphs (tarantula-including clade) display a limited diversity of silk glands and spigot types. -"...plesiomorphic araneomorphs are unique in retaining the cribellum, a functional homolog of the anterior median spinnerets that produces extremely sticky silk. It is tempting to speculate that the diversity of araneomorph spiders is related to this important innovation. However, ..." goes on to say why we should not jump to this conclusion. -"RTA Clade" includes Lycosoids, Dionycha -most members of the superfamily Lycosoidea "including nearly all of the speciose family Lycosidae, have forsaken the web habit for a more cursorial hunting style." -Dionycha: "The derived two-clawed condition, in which the third claw is generally lost or very reduced and tufts of setae adorn the leg tip, characterizes the Dionycha. ... These are primarily hunting animals that have forsaken webs as a foraging technique. The claw tuft, and/or the continuation of dense setae along the tarsus as a scopula, is known to improve traction on smooth surfaces. Another role of the scopula may be to improve prey manipulation during attacks." Dionycha includes: Gnaphosidae, Salticidae, Anyphaenidae, Thomisidae [controversial] -Gnaphosidae: don't spin catching webs; wandering (vagrant) species -Salticidae: largest family of spiders; stalk prey and jump at them with high accuracy (see Blickhan papers) see also: -Hausdorf B Molecular phylogeny of araneomorph spiders J EVOLUTION BIOL 12 (5): 980-985 SEP 1999 -Bond JE, Opell BD Testing adaptive radiation and key innovation hypotheses in spiders [AMPref No.283] -Ramirez MJ A phylogenetic analysis of the subfamilies of Anyphaenidae (Arachnida, Araneae) ENTOMOL SCAND 26 (4): 361-384 1995},

Here, we describe the challenges of adhesion control and the timescales involved across diverse biological attachment systems and different adhesive mechanisms. The most widespread control principle for dynamic surface attachment in climbing animals is that adhesion is ‘shear-sensitive’ (directional): pulling adhesive pads towards the body results in strong attachment, whereas pushing them away from it leads to easy detachment, providing a rapid mechanical ‘switch’. Shear-sensitivity is based on changes of contact area and adhesive strength, which in turn arise from non-adhesive default positions, the mechanics of peeling, pad sliding, and the targeted storage and controlled release of elastic strain energy. The control of adhesion via shear forces is deeply integrated with the climbing animals’ anatomy and locomotion, and involves both active neuromuscular control, and rapid passive responses of sophisticated mechanical systems. The resulting dynamic adhesive systems are robust, reliable, versatile and nevertheless remarkably simple. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Transdisciplinary approaches to the study of adhesion and adhesives in biological systems’.},

   url = {https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspa.1975.0138 %X This paper describes a study of the adhesion between elastic solids and the effect of roughness in reducing the adhesion. The experiments were carried out between optically smooth rubber spheres and a hard smooth flat surface of Perspex which could be roughened to various degrees. The radius of the rubber spheres was varied by a factor of 8, their elastic modulus by a factor of 10, while the centre line average (c.l.a.)of the roughened Perspex surface was varied from 0.12 to 1.5 μm. The results show that c.l.a. roughnesses which are small compared with the overall deformation occurring at the region of the rubber-Perspex contact can produce an extremely large reduction in adhesion. The effect is more marked for rubbers of higher modulus. On the other hand the curvature of the sphere (over the range examined) has little influence. For this reason and because the analytical problem of a sphere on a rough flat is extremely complicated a theoretical analysis has been developed for the simpler case of a smooth flat in contact with a rough flat surface. As in Greenwood &amp; Williamson (1966) the rough surface is modelled by asperities all of the same radius of curvature and with heights following a Gaussian distribution of standard deviation σ. The overall contact force is obtained by applying the contact theory of Johnson, Kendall &amp; Roberts (1971) to each individual asperity. The theory predicts that the adhesion expressed as a fraction of the maximum value depends upon a single parameter, 1/Δe,which is the ratio between a and the elastic displacement δC that the tip of an asperity can sustain before it pulls off from the other surface. The analysis shows that the adhesion parameter may also be regarded as representing the statistical average of a competition between the compressive forces exerted by the higher asperities trying to prize the surfaces apart and the adhesive forces between the lower asperities trying to hold the surfaces together. Although the theory is derived for two nominally plane surfaces it is found to fit the experimental results for a sphere on a flat reasonably well.},

Force measurements were performed with tethered walking insects, both males and females, on five different substrates: (i) smooth glass plate, (ii) smooth solid Al2O3 (sapphire) disc, and (iii–v) porous Al2O3 discs (anodisc membranes) with the same pore diameter but different porosity. The traction force of beetles ranged from 0.16 to 16.59 mN in males and from 0.32 to 8.99 mN in females. In both sexes, the highest force values were obtained on smooth solid surfaces, where males showed higher forces than females. On all three porous substrates, forces were significantly reduced in both males and females, and the only difference within these surfaces was obtained between membranes with the highest and lowest porosity. Males produced essentially lower forces than females on porous samples. The reduction in insect attachment on anodisc membranes may be explained by (i) possible absorption of the secretion fluid from insect adhesive pads by porous media and/or (ii) the effect of surface roughness. Differences in attachment between males and females were probably caused by the sexual dimorphism in the terminal structure of adhesive setae.},

These biological adhesives have to meet conflicting demands: attachment must be strong and reliable, yet detachment should be fast and effortless. Climbing animals can rapidly and reversibly control their pads' adhesive strength by shear forces, but the mechanisms underlying this coupling have remained unclear. Here, we show that adhesive forces of stick insect pads closely followed the predictions from tape peeling models when shear forces were small, but strongly exceeded them when shear forces were large, resulting in an approximately linear increase of adhesion with friction. Adhesion sharply increased at peel angles less than ca 30°, allowing a rapid switch between attachment and detachment. The departure from classic peeling theory coincided with the appearance of pad sliding, which dramatically increased the peel force via a combination of two mechanisms. First, partial sliding pre-stretched the pads, so that they were effectively stiffer upon detachment and peeled increasingly like inextensible tape. Second, pad sliding reduces the thickness of the fluid layer in the contact zone, thereby increasing the stress levels required for peeling. In combination, these effects can explain the coupling between adhesion and friction that is fundamental to adhesion control across all climbing animals. Our results highlight that control of adhesion is not solely achieved by direction-dependence and morphological anisotropy, suggesting promising new routes for the development of controllable bio-inspired adhesives.},

A cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces. Previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism. The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force–volume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre. Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force. Our data provide the first direct evidence that, in addition to Van der Waals and Coulomb forces, attractive capillary forces, mediated by pad secretion, are a critical factor in the fly's attachment mechanism.},

Studies on the chemical composition and evaporation dynamics of tarsal secretions strongly suggest a difference in chemistry of secretion in beetles and flies, both possessing hairy attachment devices. This difference is assumed to influence the viscosity of the secretion. Here, we applied a microrheological technique, based on the immersion of nanometric beads in the collected tarsal footprints, to estimate secretion viscosity in a beetle (Coccinella septempunctata) and a fly (Calliphora vicina). Both species studied possess distinct differences in viscosity, the median of which was calculated as 21.8 and 10.9 mPa s, respectively. We further present an approximate theoretical model to calculate the contact formation time of spatula-like terminal contact elements using the viscosity data of the covering fluid. The estimated contact formation time is proportional to the tarsal secretion viscosity and to the square of the contact radius of the contact element.},

For spiders, lizards and possible other ‘dry’ adhesive systems, explanations for adhesion are based on van der Waals interaction, and the adhesion of single–contact elements has been described by the classical Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) model derived for spherical contacts. However, real biological contacts display a variety of shapes and only rarely resemble a hemisphere. Here, we theoretically assess the influence of various contact shapes on the pull–off force for single contacts as well as their scaling potential in contact arrays. It is concluded that other shapes, such as a toroidal contact geometry, should lead to better attachment; such geometries are observed in our microscopic investigations of hair–tip shapes in beetles and flies.},

We showed previously that even geckos, which can stick to most surfaces under a wide variety of conditions, slip on PTFE. Surprisingly, however, geckos can stick reasonably well to PTFE if it is wet. In an effort to explain this effect, we have turned our attention to the role of substrate surface energy and roughness when shear adhesion occurs in media other than air. In this study, we removed the roughness component inherent to commercially available PTFE and tested geckos on relatively smooth wet and dry fluoropolymer substrates. We found that roughness had very little effect on shear adhesion in air or in water and that the level of fluorination was most important for shear adhesion, particularly in air. Surface energy calculations of the two fluorinated substrates and one control substrate using the Tabor–Winterton approximation and the Young–Dupré equation were used to determine the interfacial energy of the substrates. Using these interfacial energies we estimated the ratio of wet and dry normal adhesion for geckos clinging to the three substrates. Consistent with the results for rough PTFE, our predictions show a qualitative trend in shear adhesion based on fluorination, and the quantitative experimental differences highlight the unusually low shear adhesion of geckos on dry smooth fluorinated substrates, which is not captured by surface energy calculations. Our work has implications for bioinspired design of synthetics that can preferentially stick in water but not in air.},

For example, the gecko can adhere to rough, wet and dirty surfaces; however, most synthetic mimics cannot maintain function when faced with a similar situation. The solution to this problem lies in a more thorough investigation of the natural system. Here, we review the adhesive system of the gecko toe pad, as well as the far less-well-studied anti-adhesive system that results from the chemistry and structure of the toe pad (superhydrophobicity). This paradoxical relationship serves as motivation to study functional optimization at the system level. As an example, we experimentally investigate the role of surface lipids in adhesion and anti-adhesion, and find a clear performance trade-off related to shear adhesion in air on a hydrophilic surface. This represents the first direct investigation of the role of surface lipids in gecko adhesion and anti-adhesion, and supports the argument that a system-level approach is necessary to elucidate optimization in biological systems. Without such an approach, bioinspired designs will be limited in functionality and context, especially compared to the natural systems they mimic.

Visualizing the evolutions of real contact area of single microfibres, it is shown that the mushroom-shaped geometry of contact elements promotes fast and simple generation of reliable adhesion. The mushroom-shaped geometry seems to transform fibrillar contact elements into passive suction devices and makes them tolerant to overload, thus enhancing their robustness and stability. These findings may also be extrapolated to biological fibrillar attachment devices sharing the same geometry.},

Detailed studies have revealed that geckos are ‘sticky’ without the use of glue or suction devices. Instead, a gecko's stickiness derives from van der Waals interactions between proteinaceous hairs called setae and substrate. Here, we present surprising evidence that although geckos do not use glue, a residue is transferred on surfaces as they walk—geckos leave footprints. Using matrix-free nano-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry, we identified the residue as phospholipids with phosphocholine head groups. Moreover, interface-sensitive sum-frequency generation spectroscopy revealed predominantly hydrophobic methyl and methylene groups and the complete absence of water at the contact interface between a gecko toe pad and the substrate. The presence of lipids has never been considered in current models of gecko adhesion. Our analysis of gecko footprints and the toe pad–substrate interface has significant consequences for models of gecko adhesion and by extension, the design of synthetic mimics.},

This hierarchical surface construction gives the gecko the adaptability to create a large real area of contact with surfaces. It is known that van der Waals force is the primary mechanism used to adhere to surfaces, and capillary force is a secondary effect that can further increase adhesive force. To investigate the effects of capillarity on gecko adhesion, we considered the capillary force as well as the solid-to-solid interaction. The capillary force expressed in terms of elliptical integral is calculated by numerical method to cope with surfaces with a wide range of contact angles. The adhesion forces exerted by a single gecko spatula in contact with planes with different contact angles for various relative humidities are calculated, and the contributions of capillary force to total adhesion force are evaluated. The simulation results are compared with experimental data. Finally, using the three-level hierarchical model recently developed to simulate a gecko seta contacting with random rough surface, the effect of the relative humidity and the hydrophobicity of surface on the gecko adhesion is investigated.},
